# DirDiff
Creating a project, mostly so I can come back to it. In moving NAS's I have to move around a few million files and I want to make triple sure I have an integrity check. Also need to span stuff across different places and reconverge them. So some shell scripts to move stuff around and not lose place. Hopefully I'll never do this again.
